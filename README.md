# CSE321: Operating Systems (Summer 2025)


This course provides a general understanding of the principles and concepts governing the functions of operating systems and acquaints students with the state-of-the-art approaches that make the design, implementation, and operation of complex operating systems possible. The core of the course contains concurrent programming (threads and synchronization), inter-process communication, process and thread management, storage and resource management and communication, and an analysis on security and protection.

Course Objectives
- Understanding core concepts of OS structures, process management and inter process communication methods.
- Interpreting CPU schedulers and their functions.
- Understanding the concepts and behaviours of threads and examine the concurrency of multithreading.
- Inspecting thread synchronization mechanisms in OS level.
- Understanding the secondary memory management and file systems concepts and analysing file system implementation.
- Understanding mechanisms of main and virtual memory management of OS.
- Analysing OS level security threats and the methods used to provide protection from the threats.
